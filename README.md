# Storybooks
## Personalize your storybook
In this project we will edit a Word file, modify it and move it to pdf to have the customized storybook.
I use the phpOffice library.

### How it works:
The word file has to be in the project folder and then modify the file name in the code, the words you want to change you must also modify it in the code where it indicates commented.
The words must be written in the word file like this:

```sh
${potato}
```
